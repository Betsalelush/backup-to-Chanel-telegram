# Test Results for Telegram Message Manager

## Testing Protocol

### Backend Testing Protocol
- ALWAYS test backend API endpoints using `deep_testing_cloud` with comprehensive curl commands
- Test authentication, session management, job creation, and WebSocket connections
- Verify MongoDB integration and data persistence
- Check error handling and rate limiting

### Frontend Testing Protocol  
- ONLY test frontend after explicit user permission
- Use `deep_testing_cloud` for comprehensive UI testing with Playwright
- Test responsive design, RTL support, and all user workflows
- Verify WebSocket real-time updates and error states

### Communication Protocol
- Always read and update this file before testing
- Document all test results, failures, and fixes
- Never duplicate testing that has already been completed
- Focus on integration testing over unit testing

## Current Test Status

### Backend Tests
- **Status**: Ready for testing
- **Last Updated**: Frontend components completed
- **Required**: 
  - API endpoint functionality
  - Telegram integration
  - Database operations
  - WebSocket connections

### Frontend Tests  
- **Status**: Ready for testing (pending user permission)
- **Last Updated**: All components implemented
- **Components Completed**:
  - All page components (Dashboard, Sessions, Jobs, CreateJob, JobDetail, Settings, Login)
  - Layout components (Layout, Sidebar, Header)
  - UI components (LoadingSpinner)
  - Context providers (Auth, WebSocket, Theme)

## Integration Status

### Completed
- ✅ FastAPI backend structure with comprehensive endpoints
- ✅ TelegramManager with session handling and QR authentication
- ✅ Complete React frontend with all pages and components
- ✅ Database models and schemas
- ✅ WebSocket infrastructure
- ✅ Authentication system with JWT
- ✅ Environment variables properly configured
- ✅ All services running (backend, frontend, mongodb)

### In Progress
- Backend API testing and validation
- Frontend user workflow testing

### Pending
- Integration with existing Python scripts (tor.py, seshenqr.py, etc.)
- Production deployment configuration
- Advanced features implementation

## Known Issues
- Telegram API credentials not set (expected)
- Existing Python scripts not yet integrated into backend
- WebSocket URL configuration needs verification

## Incorporate User Feedback
- All essential components have been implemented
- Application structure is complete and ready for testing
- Services are running and accessible

## Next Steps
1. Test backend API functionality using deep_testing_cloud
2. Ask user permission for frontend testing
3. Fix any issues found during testing
4. Integrate existing Python scripts
5. Add missing Telegram API credentials when provided
