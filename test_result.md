# Test Results for Telegram Message Manager

## Testing Protocol

### Backend Testing Protocol
- ALWAYS test backend API endpoints using `deep_testing_cloud` with comprehensive curl commands
- Test authentication, session management, job creation, and WebSocket connections
- Verify MongoDB integration and data persistence
- Check error handling and rate limiting

### Frontend Testing Protocol  
- ONLY test frontend after explicit user permission
- Use `deep_testing_cloud` for comprehensive UI testing with Playwright
- Test responsive design, RTL support, and all user workflows
- Verify WebSocket real-time updates and error states

### Communication Protocol
- Always read and update this file before testing
- Document all test results, failures, and fixes
- Never duplicate testing that has already been completed
- Focus on integration testing over unit testing

## Current Test Status
